# Installation
The latest release version of `tsx` can be installed via

```

# Documentation
The documentation for the latest release version is available [here](https://matthiasjakobs.github.io/tsx). 
Notice that this code base is heavily work in progress and APIs might change and break.
We are actively maintaining the functionality documented above and try our best to not change the API.
Undocumented functionality, however, should not be relied upon.
If you like to use undocumented code, please make sure to check out a specific commit from Github instead of the latest `dev` version.
