# Quickstart
`tsx` latest stable version is available to install via

```
pip install tsx
```

Every documented class and function will be maintained and (very rarely) change behavior. Everything inside `tsx` that is undocumented is work and progress and no guarantees are given that function signatures etc. are compatible between versions
